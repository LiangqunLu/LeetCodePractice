# 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

```html
Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

## Algorithms
Binary Tree Building
- generate array from the singly linked list
- select median value as root
- the left side as root.left and right side as root.right
- recursive to generate a binary search tree (start with another function to implement recursion)

## Code in Python3
```python
class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: ListNode) -> TreeNode:
        
        arr = []
        while head:
            arr.append(head.val)
            head = head.next
            
        return self.Tree(arr)
    
    def Tree(self, arr):
        if not arr:
            return None
        # l, r = 0, len(arr) - 1
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        root = TreeNode(arr[mid])
        root.left = self.Tree(arr[:mid])
        root.right = self.Tree(arr[(mid+1):])
        
        return root  
```
