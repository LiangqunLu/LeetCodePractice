# 1005. Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations

```html
Given an array A of integers, we must modify the array in the following way: we choose an i and replace A[i] with -A[i], and we repeat this process K times in total.  (We may choose the same index i multiple times.)

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [4,2,3], K = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose indices (1,) and A becomes [4,-2,3].
Example 2:

Input: A = [3,-1,0,2], K = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 2, 2) and A becomes [3,1,0,2].
Example 3:

Input: A = [2,-3,-1,5,-4], K = 2
Output: 13
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 4) and A becomes [2,3,-1,5,4].
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 10000
1 <= K <= 10000
-100 <= A[i] <= 100
```

## Algorithms
Greedy + heapq
- use heapify to store array
- keeping pop min value for K times
- get max values

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def largestSumAfterKNegations(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        
        # heapq
        total = sum(A)
        heapq.heapify(A)
        while K > 0:
            minV = heapq.heappop(A)
            heapq.heappush(A, -minV)
            K -= 1
            total += 2 * (-minV)
        return total
```
